# accsr: Simple tools for loading data and configurations 

This lightweight library contains utilities for managing, loading, uploading, 
opening and generally wrangling data and
configurations. It was battle tested in multiple projects at appliedAI. 

The main useful abstractions provided by this library are:
1. The `RemoteStorage`class for a safe, git-like, programmatic access to 
data stored in any cloud storage.
2. The configuration module for a simple, yet powerful configuration management.
